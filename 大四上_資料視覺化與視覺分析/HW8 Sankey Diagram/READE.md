# Sankey Diagram
## Objective:
Craft a Sankey Diagram to represent car evaluation data using D3.

Example code: https://d3-graph-gallery.com/sankey.html

Data Source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/19/car+evaluation

 

## Requirements:
Data Preparation:

Preprocess the data, ensuring you have valid pairings between attributes for the Sankey Diagram. This might involve calculating frequency counts for each category combination across the mentioned attributes.

Sankey Diagram Creation:

Display relationships between the categorical attributes: buying, maintenance, doors, persons, luggage boot, and safety.
Ensure that the width of the bands in the Sankey Diagram represents the proportion or count of the dataset that holds that relationship.
## Design & Interactivity:
Draggable Nodes: Users should be able to rearrange the Sankey nodes to declutter the view or focus on specific relationships.
Tooltips: Implement interactive tooltips that show ratios or raw counts when users hover over the bands in the Sankey diagram.
Visual Design: Ensure a clear color distinction for different categories, and provide a legend or key that explains any color or symbol used.
