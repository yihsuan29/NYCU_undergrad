# Horizon Chart
## Objective:
Craft a horizon chart to represent air pollution data using D3.

Example code: https://observablehq.com/@d3/horizon-chart

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bappekim/air-pollution-in-seoul

Districts & Pollutants: There are 25 districts in Seoul, and data is available for 6 different pollutants. This necessitates the creation of 150 horizon charts.
Data Period: The dataset covers hourly readings from 2017 through 2019. For this assignment, you should let users focus solely on data from a specific year.
## Requirements:
Data Preparation: Aggregate hourly data into daily summaries. You can use the mean, median, or another appropriate measure as a representative value for each day.

Horizon Chart Creation: Develop a horizon chart for each combination of district and pollutant, resulting in 150 charts. Ensure clear labeling for each chart indicating the district and pollutant it represents.

Color Variations: Use distinguishable colors for different pollutants to provide clear visual differentiation.

Layout: Organize charts in a grid or another systematic arrangement, ensuring easy comparison and identification.

Interactivity (optional): Add features like tooltips for detailed daily values or zoom capabilities to focus on specific periods.
