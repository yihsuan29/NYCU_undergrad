# ThemeRiver
## Objective:
Craft a themeriver to represent the house property sales using D3.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/htagholdings/property-sales/

 

## Requirements:
Direction of rivers: From left to right.

Data Representation: Render streams for two property types and various bedrooms, with each stream showing the median price aggregation over time.

Reordering Capability: Your visualization should enable the reordering of streams.

 

## Design Enhancements:
Color Variations: Use distinct colors to represent property types and the number of bedrooms.

Interactive Features: Implement interactive elements such as tooltips that display exact prices when hovered over a specific section of the stream, or clickable legends to hide/show specific criteria.

Additional Techniques: Feel free to introduce other design methodologies that can amplify the clarity and aesthetic of the data representation.
