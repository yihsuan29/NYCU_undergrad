# Brushable Scatter Plot Matrix
## Goal
For your upcoming assignment, you are to construct brushable scatter plot matrices for the Iris dataset utilizing D3. Given the dataset has four features for each class, your task involves generating a 4x4 scatter plot grid. Each plot should represent the relationship between two attributes, while plots along the diagonal should display histograms of the respective attribute. Furthermore, your system should enable users to select specific data points within a plot, and these selected points should be emphasized in the other plots for easier analysis. Incorporate color variations, interactive features, or any other design techniques that will enhance data representation. If there are any questions, please feel free to ask.
