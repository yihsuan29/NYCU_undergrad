# Parallel Coordinate Plots
## Goal
In this homework, your goal is to implement a web-based parallel coordinate plot to show the iris dataset (the same as your homework #1) using D3. Users should be able to change the order of the axis because the attribute relations are difficult to observe if they are far away. Besides, please render poly-lines (flower samples) in different hues to represent the flower classes (three in total). In this case, the attribute relations of different flowers can be further visualized.
