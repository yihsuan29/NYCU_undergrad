# Stacked Bar Charts
## Objective:
Craft stacked bar charts to represent the World University Rankings using D3.

Data Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddosad/timesworlduniversityrankings2024

## Requirements:
Direction of Stack: You can choose either a vertical or horizontal stacking style.

Data Representation: Every stacked bar should represent the total score of a particular university. Within each bar, the scores for different criteria—namely teaching, research, citations, industry income, and international—should be clearly distinguishable.

Sorting Capability: Your visualization should enable sorting of universities:

By overall scores.
By each individual criterion (teaching, research, citations, industry income, and international).
Both in ascending and descending orders.

## Design Enhancements:
Color Variations: Use distinct colors to represent each criterion within the stacked bars.

Interactive Features: Implement interactive elements such as tooltips that display exact scores when hovered over a specific section of the bar, or clickable legends to hide/show specific criteria.

Additional Techniques: Feel free to introduce any other design methodologies that can amplify the clarity and aesthetic of the data representation.
